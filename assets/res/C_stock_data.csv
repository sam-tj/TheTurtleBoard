LCD Interface;"An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen is an electronic display module and has a wide range of applications. A 16x2 LCD display is very basic module and is very commonly used in various devices and circuits. A 16x2 LCD means it can display 16 characters per line and there are 2 such lines. In this LCD each character is displayed in 5x7 pixel matrix. The 16 x 2 intelligent alphanumeric dot matrix display is capable of displaying 224 different characters and symbols. This LCD has two registers namely Command and Data.";images/lcdCon.png;"https://github.com/sam-tj/TheTurtleBoard/blob/master/samples/lcd_interface/lcd_interface.ino";"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sam-tj/TheTurtleBoard/master/samples/lcd_interface/lcd_interface.png"
Keypad Interface;"A matrix keypad is the kind of keypad you see on microwave ovens, gas pumps, and calculators.  A matrix keypad you can connect to a breadboard is also great for prototypes and inventions where things like codes, times, or other values have to be entered. It is used for loading numerics into the microcontroller. It consists of 16 buttons arranged in a form of an array containig four lines and four columns. It is connected to the development system by regular IDC 10 female connector.";images/keyCon.png;"https://github.com/sam-tj/TheTurtleBoard/blob/master/samples/keypad_interface/keypad_interface.ino"
EM-18 Interface;"EM-18 RFID reader is one of the commonly used RFID reader to read 125KHz tags. It features low cost, low power consumption, small form factor and easy to use. It can interact with a microcontroller in any one of the two supported protocols namely TTL Serial & Wiegand 26 as per the system design.";images/em18Con.png
Buzzer;"A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device. Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input. It  It is very small and compact 2-pin structure hence can be easily used.";images/defaultBoard.png
RGB LED;"RGB LED is basically an LED package that can produce almost any color. It can be used in different applications. RGB LEDs have three internal LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue) that can be combined to produce almost any color output. In order to produce different kinds of colors, we need to set the intensity of each internal LED and combine the three color outputs.";images/defaultBoard.png;"https://github.com/sam-tj/TheTurtleBoard/blob/master/samples/rgb_led/rgb_led.ino";"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sam-tj/TheTurtleBoard/master/samples/rgb_led/rgb_led_blocks.png"
LDR;"An LDR is a light-dependent resistor (or photo-conductive cell). It is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing circuits. ";images/defaultBoard.png
Push Button;"A Push Button switch is a type of switch which consists of a simple electric mechanism or air switch mechanism to turn something on or off. Push button switches are used throughout industrial and medical applications and are also recognisable in everyday life.";images/defaultBoard.png
